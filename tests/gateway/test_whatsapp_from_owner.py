"""Tests for WhatsApp owner-message metadata and source-level text tagging.

The Node bridge sets ``fromOwner: true`` on inbound `fromMe` messages that
look owner-typed (linked-device send, not echoed from /send) when the
operator opts into ``WHATSAPP_FORWARD_OWNER_MESSAGES``.  These tests pin
the adapter's responsibility: lift that flag onto
``MessageEvent.metadata["whatsapp_from_owner"]``, prefix ``MessageEvent.text``
with ``[owner reply] ``, and otherwise leave metadata absent and text
unchanged.  The env-var gate itself lives in the bridge — the adapter just
trusts the payload.
